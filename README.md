# Mental Health Fitness Predictor

This repository contains a project on Mental Health Fitness, focused on predicting mental health using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes two datasets imported from Kaggle, providing valuable insights into mental health analysis and prediction.

## Description
Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being, and this project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict mental health using two powerful algorithms: Linear Regression Model and Random Forest Regression. By analyzing various factors related to mental health, this project offers a predictive model that can assist in understanding and addressing mental health concerns.

## Key Features
- Import and preprocess two datasets from Kaggle, containing relevant information about mental health.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the datasets and understand the underlying patterns and relationships.
- Train a Linear Regression Model and a Random Forest Regression Model using the processed data.
- Evaluate the performance of both models and compare their predictive capabilities.
- Utilize cross-validation techniques to ensure the reliability and generalizability of the models.
- Provide interactive visualizations to enhance the understanding of mental health factors and their impact on overall well-being.
- Offer a user-friendly interface to allow users to input relevant parameters and obtain predictions regarding their mental health fitness.
